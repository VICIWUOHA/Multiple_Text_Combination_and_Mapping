## The aim of this project was to find all possible answers to a quiz with 10 questions which had two options each.

### CONSIDERATIONS

- Only one answer can be picked per question.
- Final output should not have any duplicate combination of answers.
- Lastly, assuming all items in the left list (option 1) stood for ODD (O) selections, while those in the right stood for EVEN (E); Map the final output as Os and Es .

### Libraries Used
- pandas
- random
- numpy

##### Other methods
- translate( ) - Used in the map_text function based to translate input based on predefined values.
